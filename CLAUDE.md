# weirdcode

I want to do a demo of something fun with a weird architecture or design. 

1. First research some fun stunt hacks that used weird tricks Motivating examples:
* [Page Fault Liberation Army](https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5265.en.html)
* [Movfuscator](https://github.com/xoreaxeaxeax/movfuscator)
2. Suggest some good demos to do with these hacks. One example might be to run Doom.
